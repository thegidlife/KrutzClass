<center> <h3> We Were Made To Be Couregous </h3>
</center>
<p> Imagine a life where we would all just pursue our dreams. A life where we just let go of all the things that held us back.
How successful do you think you'd be? What would you be doing? Honestly, I belive that there are no obstacles if we refuse to see them. As Les Brown once said
"you do not have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great." You might not pursue your dreams because you may be a novice to the task at hand, 
you might be lacking something that you feel you need, or you might just be scared to fail. The fact of the matter is that those factors are insignifacnt because
you are not ever going to swim unless they let you drown. I promise that despite not knowing how, if you really look, you will find a way. It is not until you 
take that first step, that you will see the entire stairecase.  - Gideon Wikina </p>

<center> <h3> The Situation  </h3>
</center>
<p> I remember Kent Julian staring me in the eye teling me that it was never about the events that transpired in our lives. It was always about how we responded to 
our current situation. That statement resonannated with me. It made me realize that at the end of the day we will not be judged on our situation but on how we 
overcame it. If you are sitution that seems bigger than yourself, do not give up! Keep going! Keep pushing! If you outlast the dragon, you will win! Once you win,
the results shows and your affirmation grows.
